# Getting Started — PIVOT Test File Review

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or later** — download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - During installation, check **"Add Python to PATH"**
- **Git** (optional) — needed only to clone; team members without Git can download the repo as a ZIP from GitHub

---

## One-Time Setup

### Step 1 — Get the code

Choose whichever method is easiest:

**Option A — Download ZIP (no tools needed)**
1. Go to the GitHub repo (link provided by your team lead)
2. Click **Code → Download ZIP**
3. Unzip the folder to wherever you want to work from

**Option B — GitHub Desktop (recommended for most users)**
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you haven't already
2. Open GitHub Desktop → **File → Clone Repository**
3. Click the **URL** tab
4. Paste the repo URL: `https://github.com/kjcolson/TestFileReviewAutomation.git`
5. For **Local Path**, choose a plain folder like `Documents` — **not** a folder already named `TestFileReviewAutomation` (GitHub Desktop creates the subfolder automatically)
6. Click **Clone**

**Option C — Command line**
```
git clone https://github.com/kjcolson/TestFileReviewAutomation.git
cd TestFileReviewAutomation
```

### Keeping up to date

If you already have the repo and get unexpected errors, pull the latest changes first:
- **GitHub Desktop**: Click **Fetch origin**, then **Pull**
- **Command line**: `git pull`

---

### Step 2 — Run setup

Double-click `setup.bat`, or from a terminal:
```
setup.bat
```
This installs the required Python packages and creates the `input\` and `output\` folders.

---

## Running a Client

### Step 1 — Create the client's input folder

```
input\
  AcmeMedical\
    billing_combined\
    gl\
    payroll\
    scheduling\
```

Folder names for source subfolders must match exactly:
`billing_combined`, `billing_charges`, `billing_transactions`, `scheduling`, `payroll`, `gl`, `quality`, `patient_satisfaction`

### Step 2 — Drop the client's files in

Copy each file into its matching source subfolder. File names don't matter — only the folder determines the source type.

### Step 3 — Run all phases

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```
py run_all.py "AcmeMedical" v1 --no-prompt
```

Replace `AcmeMedical` with the client name (must match the folder you created) and `v1` with the round number.

---

## Output

All reports are written to `output\{ClientName}\`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `*_Phase5_*.xlsx` | **The main deliverable** — 9-sheet consolidated report |
| `*_Phase1_*.xlsx` through `*_Phase4_*.xlsx` | Per-phase detail (for internal review) |
